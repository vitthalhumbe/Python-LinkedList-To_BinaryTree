# Linked List to Binary Tree Conversion

A Python script for converting a linked list into a binary tree using the "binarytree" library. This code, authored by **Vitthal Humbe**, takes user-input values, stores them in a linked list, and then transforms the list into a binary tree for visualization.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Install the required library using `pip install binarytree`.
3. Run the script: `python linkedlist_to_binarytree.py`.
4. Enter space-separated values as prompted.
5. The linked list will be displayed, followed by the corresponding binary tree.
